# Extract Info with LLM

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and resources used in a tutorial video hosted on YouTube, demonstrating how to extract information from PDF invoices using a Local Language Model (LLM). The tutorial is designed to provide hands-on experience with setting up a local LLM server, processing PDFs, and extracting data efficiently.

## Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn the following:

1. **Introduction to LM Studio**: Get familiar with the LM Studio, a tool that allows you to run language models locally.
2. **Installing a Local Model**: Steps to download and install a local language model suitable for information extraction tasks.
3. **Running a Local Server**: Set up and launch a local server that can handle API requests for text processing.
4. **Processing PDF Invoices**: Convert PDF invoices into text and use the local language model to extract relevant information.
5. **Storing Extracted Data**: Save the extracted data in either CSV or Excel formats for further analysis.

## Features

- **Cost-Effective**: Running models locally eliminates cloud costs.
- **Privacy**: Your data stays on your machine, ensuring confidentiality.
- **Offline Capability**: Once set up, the system can operate without an internet connection.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**: Sufficient computing power to run LLMs locally.
- **Software**:
  - R Programming Language
  - PDF processing libraries
  - LM Studio

## Troubleshooting
- Model Loading Issues: Ensure that the model is correctly installed in LM Studio.
- Server Connectivity: Verify that the local server is running and accessible.
- Dependencies: Make sure all required R packages are installed
